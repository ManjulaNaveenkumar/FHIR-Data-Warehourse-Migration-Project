HAPI FHIR Infrastructure Setup

Docker Desktop was used to deploy a HAPI FHIR R4 server in a containerized environment.

Command used to start the server:

docker run -d --name hapi-fhir-server -p 8081:8080 hapiproject/hapi:latest

Port Mapping Explanation:
- Container Port 8080: HAPI FHIR internal server port
- Host Port 8081: Exposed port to access the server from the browser

Benefits of Docker:
- Avoids Java and database installation
- Ensures consistent runtime environment across systems
- Simplifies deployment and teardown

FHIR Server URL:
http://localhost:8081/fhir
